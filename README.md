# eShopper
The eShopper project aims to develop an online shopping and vending system that will serve buyers and sellers, providing them with a user-friendly and efficient platform for conducting business transactions. The system is designed to be similar to popular online marketplaces like Alibaba or Amazon, where buyers can browse and purchase products from various sellers, and sellers can list and sell their products to a wide range of potential customers. By creating a robust and feature-rich online platform, eShopper will revolutionize the way people buy and sell products, offering convenience, accessibility, and a seamless shopping experience for all users.
